							Coffee is a huge part of daily Vietnamese life. Vietnam is the second-largest coffee producer in the world.
							The French brought coffee to Vietnam in the 19th century, and after the Vietnam War, the government instituted a massive coffee production program.
							 By the 1990's the country’s coffee production started to take off and today Vietnam is producing over 1.73 million tons of coffee a year.

						<div class="textS">Vietnamese people drink coffee morning, noon and night, at proper cafes or on little plastic stools
							on the street.  Cafes — be they sit-down outdoor coffee shops, indoor coffee shops or more casual street-side coffee.
							The strong and bold flavor of the coffee is euphorically balanced out with the sweet, rich flavor of the condensed milk, creating a flavor utopia.
							stalls are just a few of the gathering places for people of all ages. Vietnamese coffee is in nature so strong and flavorful, it can withstand sweetness
							without losing it’s true “coffee” flavor</div>

							<div class="textS intruc">Unscrew the thin top filter from the dripper and set aside. <br>
												Add 2-3 tablespoons groundcoffee to the dripper. Shake gently to distribute evenly.
									<br>			Replace the thin top filter on top of the ground coffee and screw it to weigh down the grinds. Do not screw on too tightly.
									<br>			Place the dripper on top of a 8-ounce mug.
									<br>			Bring 6-8 ounces of cold filtered water (per cup) to a boil. Remove from heat, and let sit for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
									<br>			Pour a little hot water into the dripper, just enough to dampen it. Allow this water to drip through the grounds.
									<br>			Once the grounds have “bloomed”, continue slowly pouring the rest of the water into the dripper.
									<br>			Cover with the metal cover to trap in the steam, and allow the water to slowly drip through the grounds.
									<br>			After all of the water has passed through the filter (about 4-5 minutes), carefully remove the dripper with the grounds and discard.
									<br>			Pour yourself a cup and enjoy!</div>
